# Frontend Changes - Dark/Light Theme Toggle

This document describes the changes made to implement a dark/light theme toggle feature for the Course Materials Assistant frontend.

## Overview

Added a theme toggle button that allows users to switch between dark and light themes with smooth transitions, proper accessibility, and persistent theme preference storage.

## Files Modified

### 1. `frontend/index.html`
- **Added theme toggle button** in the header section
- Button includes both sun and moon SVG icons for visual feedback
- Positioned in top-right corner of header
- Includes proper ARIA labels and accessibility attributes
- Made header visible (was previously hidden)

### 2. `frontend/style.css`
- **Added light theme CSS variables** using `[data-theme="light"]` selector
- **Updated header styling** to display as flexbox with space-between layout
- **Added theme toggle button styles** with hover and focus states
- **Implemented theme icon animations** with smooth rotation and opacity transitions
- **Added global transition rules** for smooth theme switching (300ms ease)
- **Created light theme color palette** with proper contrast ratios:
  - Background: `#ffffff` (white)
  - Surface: `#f8fafc` (light gray)
  - Text Primary: `#1e293b` (dark slate)
  - Text Secondary: `#64748b` (medium slate)
  - Borders: `#e2e8f0` (light gray)

### 3. `frontend/script.js`
- **Added theme toggle DOM element** to global variables
- **Implemented theme initialization function** that:
  - Checks for saved theme preference in localStorage
  - Falls back to system preference (`prefers-color-scheme`)
  - Sets initial theme on page load
- **Added theme toggle functionality** with:
  - Click and keyboard (Enter/Space) event handlers
  - Theme preference persistence in localStorage
  - System theme change detection
- **Created theme utility functions**:
  - `initializeTheme()` - Initialize theme on page load
  - `toggleTheme()` - Switch between light and dark themes
  - `setTheme(theme)` - Apply theme by setting data-theme attribute

## Features Implemented

### 1. Toggle Button Design ✅
- Circular button with sun/moon icons
- Positioned in header top-right
- Smooth hover and active state animations
- Accessible keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Space)
- Visual feedback with scale transforms

### 2. Light Theme CSS Variables ✅

- High contrast ratios for accessibility
- Proper border and surface colors
- Updated welcome message styling for both themes

### 3. JavaScript Functionality ✅
- Theme switching with smooth 300ms transitions
- Persistent theme storage using localStorage
- System theme preference detection and following
- Icon animation (sun visible in dark theme, moon visible in light theme)
- Keyboard accessibility support

### 4. Implementation Details ✅
- Uses CSS custom properties for efficient theme switching
- `data-theme="light"` attribute on body element for light theme
- No data-theme attribute (default) for dark theme
- All existing UI elements work seamlessly in both themes
- Maintains current visual hierarchy and design language

## User Experience

### Theme Switching
1. **Initial Load**: Theme is determined by saved preference or system preference
2. **Manual Toggle**: Click the theme button or use keyboard (Enter/Space)
3. **Persistence**: Theme choice is saved and remembered between sessions
4. **System Integration**: Follows system dark/light mode changes when no manual preference is set

### Visual Feedback
- **Dark Theme**: Sun icon visible, moon icon hidden (user can switch to light)
- **Light Theme**: Moon icon visible, sun icon hidden (user can switch to dark)  
- **Button States**: Hover effects, focus rings, and active state animations
- **Smooth Transitions**: All color changes animate over 300ms for polished feel

### Accessibility
- Proper ARIA labels and title attributes
- Keyboard navigation support (Tab to focus, Enter/Space to activate)
- High contrast in both themes
- Focus indicators visible in both themes
- Screen reader friendly button descriptions

## Technical Notes

- Theme detection uses `window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)')`
- Theme persistence uses `localStorage.setItem('theme', value)`
- CSS transitions excluded from theme-icon class to prevent animation conflicts
- Header made visible and properly styled for theme button placement
- Compatible with all existing features and UI components

## Testing

The implementation has been tested for:
- ✅ Proper theme switching functionality
- ✅ Theme persistence across page reloads
- ✅ System theme preference detection
- ✅ Keyboard accessibility
- ✅ Smooth animations and transitions
- ✅ Visual consistency in both themes
- ✅ Application startup and integration
